			<center><h2>Arts Books</h2></center>
			<p>The Arts and Humanities offer countless opportunities to explore the reach of human reason, creativity, and imagination. There are many pathways into this intellectual richness. Some students prefer to begin with an introductory overview of a broad subject, while others would rather dive into something tightly focused. Some enjoy lecture classes, while others thrive in seminars. </p>

			<center><h2>Business Books</h2></center>
			<p>A business, also known as an enterprise, or a firm, is an entity involved in the provision of goods and/or services to consumers.[1] Businesses are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services to customers in exchange for other goods, services, or money. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises targeted for specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple individuals may be formed as an incorporated company or jointly organised as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.</p>

			<center><h2>Social Science Books</h2></center>
			<p>Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a "social science". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities[1] such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, psychology, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century.</p>

			<center><h2>Human Services Books</h2></center>
			<p>Human services is an interdisciplinary discipline with the objective of meeting human needs through an applied knowledge base, focusing on prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service populations. The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations that are designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability.</p>
